      <p>Follow these instructions to create an <a href="exam" target="_blank">exam <i
            class="tiny material-icons">open_in_new</i></a> using your existing questions.</p>
      <div id="instructions">
        <ol>
          <p>
            <li>Fill-in the exam name (text, numbers, and dashes only. Please use dashes instead of spaces). This is to help you identify the exam later.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Next, enter the number of versions of the exam (paper count) that you want to generate. This value can
              be between 1 and 100.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Check the cover page box to create an editor window for the exam cover page. This section can contain
              formatting, and is optional.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>The questions section will list all of your created questions. Check the box next to a question to
              include it in the exam.
              Clicking on the <i class="tiny material-icons">zoom_in </i> icon will display the question contents.
              (Questions can be edited on the <a href="multiple-choice-my" target="_blank">my multiple-choice questions
                <i class="tiny material-icons">open_in_new</i></a> page.)
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Instruction sections are essentially questions without answers. As the name suggests, they can be used
              for writing instructions for a subset of the questions.
              Click on the <i class="tiny material-icons">add_circle</i> icon to create an editor window for a new
              instruction section.
              You can write the section (formatting is allowed) and click on the save button to add the section to your
              questions. It will be included in the exam automatically.
              Unchecking the section will prevent it from being included in the exam. Previewing works the same as with
              regular questions.
              You can also click on the <i class="tiny material-icons">edit</i> icon to make changes to the section.
            </li>
          </p>
          <li>
            </p>Re-order the questions and instruction sections by clicking and dragging them into the order you would
            like them to appear in on the exam.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Check the appendix box to create an editor window for the appendix. This section can contain formatting,
              and is optional.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Click the <b>PREVIEW</b> button to see a preview of the exam.
              If you are happy with the exam, you can click on <b>GENERATE</b> to create the exam.
              Otherwise, you can still make changes and click on <b>PREVIEW</b> to view the modified exam.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>Clicking the <b>GENERATE</b> button will bring up a window with a list of the available exam types.
              See the next section for an explanation of these types.
              Make a selection and click on <b>SELECT</b> to generate the exam. This may take a minute or so.
              The window will display the outcome of the action. If there was a problem, you will be able to modify the
              exam details and try again.
              If the exam generated multiple versions of the paper (e.g. the paper count was greater than one and the
              exam type was standard),
              you can click on the <b>Merge PDFs?</b> button. This will create a combined pdf of all of the different
              versions of the exam, for ease of printing.
              The final step is to click on <b>Download Exam</b>. The exam will download as a .zip file.
              See the <i>Exam .zip File Contents</i> section for an explanation of this file.
              You will then have the options to create another exam, or view all of the exams that you have created.
            </li>
          </p>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h5 class="teal-text">Exam Types</h5>
      <p>When generating an exam, the final step is to choose the exam type:</p>
      <p>Selecting <i>standard</i> will create the desired number of papers in pdf format.
        The generated exams will incorporate any of the following if present: the cover page, appendix, and instruction
        sections.
      </p>
      <p>Selecting any of the learning management system options will generate a zip file (using the exam name), that
        can be imported into the corresponding system.
        At present these options DO NOT allow anything except for actual questions to be included in the exam, so all
        instruction sections etc. will be ignored.
      </p>
      <h5 class="teal-text">Exam .zip File Contents</h5>
      <p>Every type of exam downloads as a single .zip folder, which will have the name given to the exam when it was
        created. Extract the contents to start.</p>
      <p>For <i>standard</i> exams, the folder will consist of two subfolders and some files.
        The <i>answers</i> folder contains text files with the solutions to each version of the exam.
        The <i>papers</i> folder will contain pdfs of each version of the exam, and a combined version (it will have the
        same name as the exam), if it was generated.
        Most users will not need any of the other files in the main folder or any of the non-pdf files in the
        <i>papers</i> folder. These can be deleted.
      </p>
      <p>For learning management system exams, the folder will contain some files and another .zip folder with the same
        name as the exam.
        This second .zip folder can be uploaded to the learning management system to create an exam.
        The other files can be ignored or deleted.
