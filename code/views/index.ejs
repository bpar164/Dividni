      <div id="about">
        <p>Dividni is a tool for creating individualized assessments.
          These are assessments where the answer options can differ between copies of the same assessment.
          One of the main benefits of individualization is that students cannot cheat easily by sharing answers to a
          question,
          because each student should have a different set of answers for that question.
          Individualization helps to encourage students to engage with concepts rather than attempting to memorize a set
          of questions and answers.
          Additionally, instructors can reuse the questions and corresponding answers that they have written to generate
          new assessments or different versions of the same assessment,
          which reduces the time spent on writing assessments and helps to reinforce student learning.
        </p>
        <p>Dividni can be used to create individualized assessments consisting of different types of multiple-choice
          questions.
          These can be simple questions where there is just one correct answer, or where the answer is a combination of
          some of the available options.
          An assessment then consists of a number of these questions.
          Different versions of the same assessment will have different answers for each question, provided that a
          sufficient number of answer options are provided when the question is written.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to creating standalone assessments, Dividni can also generate exams that are compatible with
          learning management systems such as Canvas and Inspera.
          This means that the questions created using this system are versatile, as they can be used for generating
          Dividni assessments,
          or can be used to create assessments for learning management systems that are often already integrated into
          university courses.
          Dividni provides a convenient option for managing existing questions and assessments, that can then be
          exported to the user's assessment platform of choice.
