        <div id="about">
          <p>Dividni is a tool for creating individualized assessments. 
            These are assessments where the answer options can differ between copies of the same assessment. 
            One of the main benefits of individualization is that students cannot cheat easily by sharing answers to a question, 
            because each student should have a different set of answers for that question. 
            Individualization helps to encourage students to engage with concepts rather than attempting to memorize a set of questions and answers. 
            Additionally, instructors can reuse the questions and corresponding answers that they have written to generate new assessments or different versions of the same assessment, 
            which reduces the time spent on writing assessments and helps to reinforce student learning.
          </p>
          <p>Dividni can be used to create individualized assessments consisting of different types of multiple-choice questions. 
              These can be simple questions where there is just one correct answer, or where the answer is a combination of some of the available options. 
              This tool can also be used to create <i>Advanced</i> questions. 
              These are questions where the question description and answers are generated programmatically using C# code that instructors write themselves. 
              These questions extend the individualization capabilities of Dividni by allowing it to generate a different version of a question for each assessment, 
              instead of having to pick from a bank of available answers.
